# TODOS

* 1. find ram disk support for either platform (linux/windows/mac) and store the url in the extensionState
* 2. make use of the support (if it exists) during population of the "collection" (createDiagnosticCollection)
* Add code action for auto importing missing symbols, needs to work with the errorCollection somehow
